# Material UI Test 1

## Description 
This is for playing around with creating Material UI apps using:

- Material UI
- React
- Next.js (Server Side Rendering)

## Usage

To install, build and run from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/mandadata/rhizo-mui-test-1.git
cd rhizo-mui-test-1
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Then open a web browser at http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## Development

To run the App in dev mode:

```
git clone https://github.com/mandadata/rhizo-mui-test-1.git
cd rhizo-mui-test-1
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open a web browser at http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

In dev mode changes made to pages in the `pages/` directory should refresh into the app in real time.

Use the code editor of your choice to edit app pages in the `pages/` directory.
